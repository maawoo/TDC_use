Testing of: 
- Chunk alignment

The Landsat and Sentinel data have an additional pixel on the x and y axes (e.g. 10001x15001).
With a size of 2500x3000 there would be 30 chunks in total, 10 of which only contain the additional pixels along the edge. 
Alternative is using a size of 2501x3001 and 20 chunks, which should be a lot more efficient/faster.

Results:
- As expected 2501x3001 is a bit faster and the task streams looks a bit more efficient. 
Doesn't make a big difference with the Landsat 8 data, but is probably important for the much bigger Sentinel-2 stack!
